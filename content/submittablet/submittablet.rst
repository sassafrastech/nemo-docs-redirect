Override code
-------------

If you need to finalize and send forms having required questions not answered, you have to use an **override code**. This code is found on the settings page of each mission.

To generate an Override code:

1. Click :guilabel:`Settings` menu.
2. If the :guilabel:`Override Code` is :guilabel:`None`, click :guilabel:`Generate` to generate a new code.

.. note::

  In order to use the override code, forms must be set to allow for incomplete responses. When creating or editing a form, check the box **Allow Incomplete?**. If not initially set, forms have to be downloaded again to ODK Collect in order to take effect.

When submitting a form that allows incomplete responses a question will show up at the end saying **Is this form missing any required answers?**

- :guilabel:`I don't think so` will direct you to the next screen to save and exit the form.
- :guilabel:`Yes` you will be asked to enter the override code.
