"NEMO stores and aggregates incoming data so that field and headquarters "
"staff can quickly chart, graph, and analyze information while writing "
"reports. These reports allow for preliminary conclusions to be made in a "
"timely manner. However, other tools may be more useful for more detailed "
"analysis. For this, data can be exported from NEMO for further review in "
"other analytical software."
