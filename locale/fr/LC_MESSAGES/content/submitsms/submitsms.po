"Given the space limitations of texts, SMS-based forms are most powerful "
"when designed carefully. Certain types of questionnaires, such as "
"qualitative ones with long-text answers, are usually not a good fit. "
"However, SMS form submission allows the easy aggregations of large "
"amounts of data across distances without good mobile or internet "
"coverage. It also can be cheaper per observer, and may suit certain "
"monitoring and evaluation purposes, quantitative inquiries, or simple "
"surveys."

"New to Version 5.8 is the ability to submit an SMS response that can "
"be relayed out to a selected group of people. The feature allows users to"
" be placed into groups that can be alerted that a submission has been "
"made to nemo. This ability is called SMS Forwarding. If the \\ **SMS "
"Forwarding?** box is checked, a copy of each SMS submission will be sent "
"via SMS to all users entered in the box \\ **SMS Forward Recipients**."
msgstr ""

#: ../../content/submitsms/submitsms.rst:65
msgid ""
"An example of an appropriate situation to use SMS Forwarding is: A team "
"wants to receive an alert when an incident form is submitted to the "
"system. The incident form is not a regular submission (one may be "
"submitted once every few days or less), so there may not be someone "
"logged into the system to see it submitted. When an incident is reported,"
" it is important to alert an entire group of responders that something is"
" going on. Thus SMS Forwarding should be enabled for this form."

msgstr ""

#: ../../content/submitsms/submitsms.rst:77
msgid ""
"SMS Authentication is a feature that adds an extra measure of protection "
"against outside users from submitting forms to NEMO. Normally, NEMO only "
"accepts submissions that come from observers with their phone numbers "
"pre-registered in the system. Our SMS Authentication feature, when "
"enabled, works by requiring observers to provide an additional code when "
"submitting forms via SMS."

"Ideally, authentication codes should never be written down. Users should "
"memorize their codes. If a user forgets their code, an administrator "
"should generate a new one for them."
msgstr ""

"Activating SMS authentication adds extra security to NEMO by ensuring "
"that the registered phone number and the authentication code belong to "
"the same user. All SMS submissions that do not meet both these conditions"
" are rejected."
